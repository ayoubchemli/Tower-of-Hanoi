## Introduction
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can be moved onto any rod. The objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Features
- Implementation of both recursive and iterative algorithms to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
- Theoretical study of the problem including its history, formal definition, solution modeling, and algorithmic complexity analysis.
- Experimental study varying the size of the problem and analyzing the temporal and spatial complexity of the resolution and verification algorithms.
- Detailed report with theoretical analysis, experimental results, conclusions, references, and source code.
